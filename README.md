# Port-Scanner
A port scanner is a tool or software that is used to scan a network for open ports on a host or system. It sends packets to the target host on specific port numbers to see if they are open or closed, and then generates a report of the results. Port scanners can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.

For example, a system administrator might use a port scanner to check for open ports on their organization's network, while an attacker might use a port scanner to identify potential vulnerabilities in a target system that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access. It is important to note that port scanning may be illegal or against the terms of service of some networks, and should only be used with appropriate authorization and permissions.
